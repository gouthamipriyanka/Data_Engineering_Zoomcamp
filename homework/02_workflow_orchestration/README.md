### Quiz Questions

Complete the Quiz shown below. Itâ€™s a set of 6 multiple-choice questions to test your understanding of workflow orchestration, Kestra and ETL pipelines for data lakes and warehouses.

1) Within the execution for `Yellow` Taxi data for the year `2020` and month `12`: what is the uncompressed file size (i.e. the output file `yellow_tripdata_2020-12.csv` of the `extract` task)?
- 128.3 MB
- 134.5 MB
- 364.7 MB
- 692.6 MB

Ans: 128.3 MB (To verify this go to extract step in the logs, and check the outputs to see the output file size.)


2) What is the rendered value of the variable `file` when the inputs `taxi` is set to `green`, `year` is set to `2020`, and `month` is set to `04` during execution?
- `{{inputs.taxi}}_tripdata_{{inputs.year}}-{{inputs.month}}.csv` 
- `green_tripdata_2020-04.csv`
- `green_tripdata_04_2020.csv`
- `green_tripdata_2020.csv`

Ans: Variable for file is constructed using `{{inputs.taxi}}_tripdata_{{inputs.year}}-{{inputs.month}}.csv` , replacing the values for the above data we get `green_tripdata_2020-04.csv`

3) How many rows are there for the `Yellow` Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?
- 13,537.299
- 24,648,499
- 18,324,219
- 29,430,127

Ans:  
```SQL
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM yellow_trips.csv 
     WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM lpep_pickup_datetime) = 2020 ;
```


4) How many rows are there for the `Green` Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?
- 5,327,301
- 936,199
- 1,734,051
- 1,342,034

Ans: 1,734,051 - my output was 1733998
```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM green_trips.csv 
     WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM lpep_pickup_datetime) = 2020 ;
```

5) How many rows are there for the `Yellow` Taxi data for the March 2021 CSV file?
- 1,428,092
- 706,911
- 1,925,152
- 2,561,031

Ans: 1,925,152 
```SQL
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `project_id.dataset_name.yellow_tripdata_2021_03`;
```

6) How would you configure the timezone to New York in a Schedule trigger?
- Add a `timezone` property set to `EST` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration  
- Add a `timezone` property set to `America/New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration
- Add a `timezone` property set to `UTC-5` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration
- Add a `location` property set to `New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration  

Ans: Add a `timezone` property set to `America/New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration
